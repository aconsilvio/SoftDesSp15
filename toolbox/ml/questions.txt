Questions

1. The general trend of the curve is upward, almost quadratically.  The higher of the presentation of data that is trained on, the better the results are.
2. The curve is noiser at some of the lower precentages - 15%, 20%, etc.
3. It is possible to get a mostly smooth curve at some lower value trials - 6,7,8, but anything 10 and greater gives a very smooth curve.
4. When C=10**-1, you get a perfectly linear line.  When C=10**-15, you get a more curved line than C=10**-10.
